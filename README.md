# AHS Tag Rendering

Customises the rendering of tags. 
(1) allows for tag icons
(2) recognises hierachical tags descending from a set of root tags, and renders them with a chevron as the seperator not a comma.

Forked from the Tag Icons theme component. discourse/discourse-tag-icons
See https://meta.discourse.org/t/tag-icons-component/109757 for instructions.
